## Abstract 
In this project, we will refactor an existing code base for a fitness / health tracker. We will implement new features of our own, namely SCSS, Accessibility, Fetch API, and testing with Spies. 

## Technologies / Systems
- Javascript
- Mocha/Chai
- VSCode 
- git / Version control
- Accessibility 
- SCSS / SASS
- API Fetch/Post
- Webpack
- Testing with Spies

## Set Up 

1. *Fork* this repository - on the top right corner of the page, click the fork button, and clone down repo into your terminal. 
2. Since you don't want your project to be named "whats-cookin-starter-kit", add an optional argument after the repo url when cloning. The command should look like this: `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]`.
3. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies by running npm install.
4. To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` to interact with the application. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

## Reflections / Project Progression
This was an absolute whirlwind of a project, but we learned and grew all the same. We were able to work well as a team to navigate new territories of SCSS, Fetch API, and testing with Spies. 
The code itself was all over the place, and refactoring it took up the majority of this project.
