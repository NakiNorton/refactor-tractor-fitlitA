## Abstract 
In this project, we will refactor an existing code base for a fitness / health tracker. We will implement new features of our own, namely SCSS, Accessibility, Fetch API, and testing with Spies. 

## Technologies / Systems
- Javascript
- TDD with Mocha/Chai & Spies
- VSCode 
- git / Version control
- Accessibility 
- SCSS / SASS
- API Fetch/Post
- Webpack

## Set Up 

1. Clone down this repo. Since you don't want to name your project "webpack-starter-kit", you can use an optional argument when you run git clone (you replace the [...] with the terminal command arguments): git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
2. Remove the default remote: git remote rm origin (notice that git remote -v not gives you back nothing)
3. Create a new repo on GitHub with the name of [what you want to name the repo] to be consistent with naming
4. Copy the address that you would use to clone down this repo - something like git@github.com:...
5. Add this remote to your cloned down repo: git remote add origin [address you copied in the previous step] - do not include the brackets
6. Now try to commit something and push it up to your new repo. If everything is setup correctly, you should see the changes on GitHub.
7. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies by running npm install.
8. To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` to interact with the application. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

## Reflections / Project Progression
This was an absolute whirlwind of a project, but we learned and grew all the same. We were able to work well as a team to navigate new territories of SCSS, Fetch API, and testing with Spies. 
The code itself was all over the place, and refactoring it took up the majority of this project.
